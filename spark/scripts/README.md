You need to have "sudo" access in the server.

Supported Benchmarks:
| **Benchmarks**         |
|----------------------  |

## Generate Datasets
Before run a specific benchmark you have to generate a dataset. This
dataset will be used as an input file for the specific benchmark.
```
./gen_dataset.sh
```
In case of SQL workload you have to run also the following script to
increase the dataset size.
```sh
./sql_gen_data.sh

```

## Run experiments with enable TeraHeap
```sh
./run.sh -n 1 -o <path/to/result/directory> -t
```
## Run experiments with native (serialization/deserialization)
```sh
./run.sh -n 1 -o <path/to/result/directory> -s
```

## Kill all background processes
```sh
./run.sh -k 
```

## Other options
```sh
./run.sh -h
```

## Change JVM Option Flags
If you want to add/remove jvm flags for Spark executor please edit the
spark-defaults.conf files under ./configs/native and
./configs/teraheap

## Reduction of Memory for Out of Core Experiments
Scripts reduce memory using Cgroups. You need to set in conf.sh 
```sh
# cgset accepts K,M,G and KiB, MiB, GiB units for memory limit
MEM_BUDGET=
```
Edit spark-3.3.0/bin/spark-class file:

```sh
# Replace line: exec "${CMD[@]}"
cgexec -g memory:memlim --sticky "${CMD[@]}"
```

\Edit spark-3.3.0/bin/spark-submit file:
```sh
# Replace line: 
exec "${SPARK_HOME}"/bin/spark-class org.apache.spark.deploy.SparkSubmit "$@"
# with
cgexec -g memory:memlim --sticky "${SPARK_HOME}"/bin/spark-class org.apache.spark.deploy.SparkSubmit "$@"

```
